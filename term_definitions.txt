not_expressed_genes: regions annotated as genes incl. promoter region upstream, but not expressed above threshold and not within annotated prophage region
not_expressed_intergenic: regions not annotated as genes, but not expressed above threshold and not within annotated prophage region
true_zero_regions: regions with 0 coverage independent of annotation except outside of prophage region
expressed_intergenic: regions not annotated as genes, but expressed above threshold and not within annotated prophage region
